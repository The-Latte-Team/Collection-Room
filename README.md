# Collection Room
A homebrew application for you to view all the achievements collected in supported games.

We don't currently support online sync and this application **is not releated to Pretendo's PoC for medals** shown off in 2023

## Current Supported Games:
- FNaF Wii U Edition
- Pureya (since no update has been released yet to support the achievements, the percentage is stuck at 0% with no achievements granted)

If we start giving support for new games and you have an older version installed, it will display them with the achievements but will not grant or show percentage progress as the app and the implementation on games need to coexist for achievements to work properly.
